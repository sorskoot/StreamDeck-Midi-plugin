# Release

On the releases page you can find them. Just download the file and dubble click load in Stream Deck.


# Limitations

- At the moment the plugin can only send NoteOn with a velocity of 127 on a specified channel. If you need anything more, please create an issue explaining your needs.
- I can't test it on MacOS so that's disabled. Feel free add support for MacOS and file a pull request.
